Do you recall that cozy day, sharing a warm mug of hot chocolate?
We were sitting by the window, watching the rain fall gently outside.
You laughed about a little marshmallow melting too fast in your cup.
It was such a sweet, simple moment, full of warmth and peace.
Just us, enjoying the quiet comfort together.
