Do you remember the quiet morning, when the sun streamed in just so?
We were sitting together, and you saw the little bird outside the window.
It was perched on a branch, singing its heart out.
You gave such a sweet smile, pointing it out to me.
It was a lovely moment, just us, sharing that gentle song.
