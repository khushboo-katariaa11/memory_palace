Oh, sweetie, do you remember that lovely evening? The sky was turning all soft and golden, and Papa was telling one of his funny stories. Beta and Beti were giggling, snuggled up close, just captivated by his words. You were there, Mumma, watching them all with such a warm smile. It was such a peaceful moment, full of our happy family love.
