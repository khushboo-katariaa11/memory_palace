Do you remember those cozy evenings, dear? Mumm would often have a soft smile, glancing at Papa. Bhai would be telling a funny story, and Behen, you'd lean in close, eyes sparkling with delight. We'd all be together, warm and safe, a gentle hum of happy voices filling our home. Such sweet times, full of love, just us.
